/*
  The 'sharepoint' command for a browser handler allows download/deletion/upload from a
  sharepoint site.  
  The handlerArgs for the sharepoint command are
    "sharepoint-credentials-file": <json credentials file path>,  required, credentials file, see SSh.json sample handler for format
    "sharepoint-deletion-probability": <0-100 integer>, default  0
    "sharepoint-upload-probability": <0-100 integer>, default 0
    "sharepoint-download-probability": <0-100 integer>, default 0, sum of download+deletion+upload <= 100, download directory is browser download directory
    "sharepoint-version": "2013",  -- version, required, 2013 and 2019 are currently supported
    "sharepoint-upload-directory": <upload directory path>" -- files to be uploaded are read from this directory, default is browser download directory

  The CommandArgs are strings of the form "key:value", supported args are:
    site:<sharepoint site>   -- required
    credentialKey:<credential key contained in the credential file>

  A handler can only browse a single share point site. The username, password specified by the credentialKey are used
  to login into the site assuming NTLM authentication (i.e,  username:password is passed in the URL header).
  The Documents site is assumed to be at <site>/Documents/Forms/Allitems.aspx
