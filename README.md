## Overview

GHOSTS is an agent orchestration framework that simulates realistic users on all types of computer systems, generating human-like activity across applications, networks, and workflows. Beyond simple automation, it can dynamically reason, chat, and create content via integrated LLMs, enabling adaptive, context-aware behavior. Designed for cyber training, research, and simulation, it produces realistic network traffic, supports complex multi-agent scenarios, and leaves behind realistic artifacts. Its modular architecture allows the addition of new agents, behaviors, and lightweight clients, making it a flexible platform for high-fidelity simulations.

### Key Capabilities

- üåê **Web browsing** with realistic navigation patterns
- üìù **Document creation and editing** (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Notepad)
- üìß **Email communication** (Outlook, sending/receiving)
- üí¨ **Chat and messaging** (Pidgin, social interactions)
- üñ•Ô∏è **Terminal commands** and system operations
- üîÑ **File operations** (FTP, SFTP, downloads, uploads)
- üñ±Ô∏è **UI interactions** (clicks, mouse movements)
- üîê **Remote access** (RDP, SSH)
- ü§ñ **AI-powered content generation** (LLM integrations)
- üìä **Activity monitoring and analytics** via Grafana dashboards

## Quick Start

### Installation

The fastest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS.git
cd GHOSTS

# Start the GHOSTS API and supporting services
docker-compose up -d
```

For detailed installation instructions, platform-specific builds, and configuration options, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/quickstart/).

### Basic Usage

1. **Deploy the API Server** - Use Docker Compose or deploy to your infrastructure
2. **Install Clients** - Deploy GHOSTS clients on Windows or Linux machines
3. **Configure Timelines** - Define activities through the UI or API
4. **Monitor Activity** - View real-time NPC behavior through Grafana dashboards

See the [full documentation](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/) for detailed configuration and usage examples.

## Architecture

GHOSTS consists of several integrated components that work together to create a realistic simulation environment:

### Core Components

| Component | Description | Documentation |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **GHOSTS Client** | Cross-platform agent (Windows/Linux) that executes simulated user activities | [Client Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/core/client/) |
| **GHOSTS API** | Central server managing clients, timelines, and activity orchestration via REST and WebSocket | [API Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/core/api/) |
| **GHOSTS UI** | Web-based interface for managing machines, groups, and deploying timelines | [UI Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/core/ui/) |
| **GHOSTS Lite** | Lightweight client version for resource-constrained environments | [Lite Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/core/lite/) |

### Supporting Services

| Service | Description | Documentation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Animator** | Generates realistic NPC personas with attributes, relationships, and social networks | [Animator Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/animator/) |
| **Pandora** | Content generation server providing dynamic web content and responses | [Pandora Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/content/pandora/) |
| **Socializer** | Simulated social media platform for realistic social interactions | [Socializer Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/content/social/) |
| **Grafana Integration** | Real-time monitoring and visualization of NPC activities | [Grafana Docs](https://cmu-sei.github.io/GHOSTS/core/grafana/) |

## Use Cases

GHOSTS is designed for various cybersecurity and training scenarios:

- **Cyber Training & Exercises** - Populate training environments with realistic user activity
- **Red Team Operations** - Generate believable background noise during security assessments
- **Blue Team Training** - Create realistic network traffic for detection and analysis practice
- **Research & Development** - Test security tools and detection algorithms with realistic data
- **Cyber Range Development** - Build immersive environments with autonomous NPCs
- **Simulation & Modeling** - Generate realistic network behavior patterns for analysis
