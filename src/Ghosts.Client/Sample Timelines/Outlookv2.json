/*
  This Outlook handler relies on HandlerArgs probabilities to perform timeline events.
  The commmand args are used for formatting emails, the probabilities decide the email action.
  Delete + Create + Read + Reply <= 100

  For the delete operation, the application.json file should have a "EmailsMax" field that
  specifies that maximum number of Emails to keep in the Inbox, Sent Items folder.
  When a delete operation is done, the Inbox, Sent Items folders are pruned to this amount,
  and all emails in the Deleted Items folder are deleted.

  application.json/Email/EmailNoReply - this is a comma delimited list of strings that is used to filter emails
  chosen for a reply - if the reply recipient contains one of these strings, then that email is not chosen for
  a reply (ie. an email from 'outlook' indicates an undeliverable email and should not be reponded to)
