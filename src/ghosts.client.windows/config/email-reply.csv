I'll do my best to answer everything that comes this way, or at the very least confirm what our other resident experts already know. Which means I'll be able to answer questions for a GOOD.  LONG.  WHILE.
We had a brigade run this morning with our new COL. Talk soon. V/R 
It's moments like those that make me proud to be an NCO, and make me happy to be in the Army. 
I have received a set of the new uniform prototype for a 45 day testing. After the 45 days I'll have to give feedback on how I feel about it. They have made some nice changes for each piece of the uniform.
We rolled out of the gate just after sunrise. I was driving, SGT D was the Truck Commander, T was our gunner, and H and N were the 60mm mortar team attached to my vehicle. In fact, I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be there. 
I've been out since November, last night I get a phone call from BTS. To paraphrase things are getting deep at OSFF.
Have you talked to your first line about this?
She won't talk to me without my first line. Please advise.
Let me call you back.
Call soldier back and let him know.
Thank you.

Thank you for your time!
Status? I'm just curious...
I don't know...
BOLO
v/r,
I'm not going to make any serious changes, so don't worry.
I am looking to give it a subtle facelift - I'd love the help and expertise.
This should be fun.
