/// The 'folder' command for Watcher is intended to monitor diskspace in a target folder
/// The CommandArgs are in key:value pairs
///   path:<some folder>  - folder to watch
///   size:<max size in MB> - maximum folder size in MB
///   deletionApproach:oldest|largest|random
///
/// If max size is exceeded, then files are deleted from the folder using the deletionApproach
/// until the folder size is under max size.
/// One obvious use of this is to monitor the browser downloads directory, i.e.
/// path:%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\Downloads
/// The deletion action can result in deleting a file that is in the progress of being downloaded
/// which results in a failed download by the browser for this file. But since the goal is
/// traffic generation, this is not a deal breaker.
