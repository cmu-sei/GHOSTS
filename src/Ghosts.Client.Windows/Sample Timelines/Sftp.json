/// SFTP handler.
/// Each CommandArg is of the formation shown below, if multiple CommandArgs are present a random one is chosen for execution on each cycle.
/// Credential handling is done in the same manner as the SSH handler, see that sample timeline for documentation
/// After the <cred_key> is a ';' delimited list of SFTP commands that are executed in sequence during a cycle.
/// Downloaded files are placed in the user's default downloads directory
/// Supported commands:
/// get [remotefile] - downloads random remote file from remote host. Can specify absolute/relative path instead of [remotefile]
/// put [localfile] - uploads random remote file from local upload directory to remote host. Can specify absolute/relative path instead of [localfile]
/// cd [remotedir] - change to random directory in current directory on remote host. Can specify absolute/relative path instead of [remotedir]
/// rm [remotefile] - deletes random remote file from remote host. Can specify absolute/relative path instead of [remotefile]
/// ls [remotedir] - list remote contents of current directory, if no directory specified use current directory. Can specify absolute/relative path instead of [remotedir]
/// mkdir [randomname] - make a random directory in cwd on remote host. Can specify absolute/relative path instead of [randomname]
