# GHOSTS NPC Framework

GHOSTS simulates user activity on a computer, like creating documents, browsing websites, and downloading files. It drives various popular applications on both Windows and Linux machines. Whether you're a friendly administrator or a cyber adversary, GHOSTS can replicate your expected behavior.

GHOSTS has many use cases in cyber experimentation, training and exercise, most notably for bringing non-player characters (NPCs) to life. However, it can also be used for other purposes requiring realistic activity on a computer.

There is a [short demonstration video available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkwK-cqwjjA) (3:03).

**Version 8.2 is here!** 

GHOSTS has undergone major updates, including breaking changes introduced in version 8.0. Version 8 absorbed the [ANIMATOR](https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS-ANIMATOR) and [SPECTRE](https://github.com/cmu-sei/GHOSTS-SPECTRE) modules, simplifying the installation, configuration, and administration of a GHOSTS instance, while bringing further capabilities to core agents by integrating previously segregated data. With version 8.2, more improvements and features are introduced, making it easier and more powerful to use.

### Breaking Changes in Version 8.0:
1. Configuration file changes.
2. Database changes.
3. API endpoint changes.

There is no upgrade path from previous versions ‚Äî a fresh install is required for version 8 and beyond.

## Platform Components

### Ghosts Clients (Windows & Linux)
GHOSTS clients simulate user-like behavior on a machine. Configurable tasks include:
- Web browsing
- Document creation and editing
- Email sending and responding
- Running terminal commands
- And more.

### Ghosts API Server
The API server enables clients to interact with GHOSTS and provides the following functionality:
- Manage clients, add/remove groups, etc.
- Retrieve/manage client activity data.
- Orchestrate new tasks for clients to perform.

### Ghosts UI
The UI offers an interface for managing machines, groups, and deploying timelines, providing an easier way to interact with the GHOSTS system.

### Ghosts Lite
A minimalistic version of the Windows GHOSTS client, suitable for running on systems with limited resources.

### Pandora Content Server
A server that provides requested content to GHOSTS clients, dynamically generating responses or serving static content for training, exercises, and red-teaming.

### Pandora Socializer Server
This server allows GHOSTS clients to interact with simulated social media content, enhancing the realism of cyber scenarios.
