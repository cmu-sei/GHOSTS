// WMI handler.
// Each CommandArg is of the formation shown below, if multiple CommandArgs are present a random one is chosen for execution on each cycle.
// Credential handling is done in the same manner as the SSH handler, see that sample timeline for documentation
// After the <cred_key> is a ';' delimited list of WMI commands that are executed in sequence during a cycle.
// Supported commands:
// GetOperatingSystem
// GetBios
// GetProcessor
// GetUserList
// GetNetworkInfo
// GetFilesList
// GetProcessList
//
// The credentials file uses the same format as SFTP/SSH, but requires a 'domain' keyword in addition to 'username', 'password'
// For this to work, the target host needs to be configured to allow WMI
// The domain admin is the best choice for username/password
// The trusted hosts of the VM running GHOSTS must be set to include the IPs of any of the hosts being interrogated by WMI
// You can print the Trusted hosts if the current host by executing in Powershell:
//   winrm g winrm/config/client
// You can set Trusted Hosts to a wild card (trust all hosts) by executing in Powershell:
//  winrm s winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="*"}'
//
