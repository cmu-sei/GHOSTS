/// Notepad handler
/// Currently only one supported command 'random' which uses probabilities from Handler Args
/// During each activity cycle:
/// Choose action as either delete, create, modify, or view
/// if delete, then delete random file from output-directory
/// if create, open notepad, add random text, save as random new file to output-directory
/// if view, open notepad with existing file from input-directory
/// if modify, open notepad with existing file from output-directory, add random text, save
/// 
/// if create or modify, roll against pdf-probability and do a print to pdf if roll succeeds
/// for this to work, the default printer must be print to pdf - no checking is done if the
/// correct printer is not selected
///
/// At end of activity cycle, Notepad is closed.
///
/// CommandArgs from Timeline events is not used.
